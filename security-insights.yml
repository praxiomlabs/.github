    We take security seriously. Please report vulnerabilities privately via
    GitHub's Security Advisory feature or email. Do not open public issues
    for security concerns. We aim to acknowledge reports within 48 hours.

      All projects use cargo clippy (linting), cargo audit (vulnerability scanning),
      and cargo deny (license/dependency policy) in CI pipelines.

      Fuzz testing using cargo-fuzz with libFuzzer backend. Targets protocol
      parsers, input handlers, and trust boundary crossings. Continuous fuzzing
      in CI with nightly deep fuzzing runs.
