All Praxiom Labs projects follow the [Rust Code of Conduct](https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/code-of-conduct).

## Summary

- Please be kind and courteous. There's no need to be mean or rude.
- Respect that people have differences of opinion and that every design or implementation choice carries a trade-off and numerous costs.
- Please keep unstructured critique to a minimum.
- We will exclude you from interaction if you insult, demean or harass anyone.
- Private harassment is also unacceptable.
